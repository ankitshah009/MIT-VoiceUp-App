Wait until you are in a safe place to perform study-related activities!</p> <p>- We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of privacy. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and/or attempt to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her.</p> <p>- Accidental public disclosure may occur due to unintended data breaches including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study. In such a case, your data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes.</p> <p>- Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan.</p> <p>- Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.</p> <p>- There will be questions associated with depression including if you may be suicidal. The investigators will not provide clinical care but you will be provided a list of resources.</p> <p>The treatment or procedure may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable.</p> <p>At the beginning of the survey, the application will remind you to go to a quiet, distraction-free location where you will be able to speak out loud. It is best to complete the surveys in a room without any other people. This will limit any noises or distractions and will also provide you with the most privacy and comfort when responding to survey questions with touchscreen or audio/video recordings.</p> <p><b>Incidental Findings</b></p> <p>The tests performed in this study are for specific research purposes and are not optimized to find medical abnormalities.
