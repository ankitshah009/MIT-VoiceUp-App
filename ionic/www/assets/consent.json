Wait until you are in a safe place to perform study-related activities!</p> <p>- We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of privacy. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and/or attempt to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her.</p> <p>- Accidental public disclosure may occur due to unintended data breaches including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study. In such a case, your data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes.</p> <p>- Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan.</p> <p>- Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.</p> <p>- There will be questions associated with depression including if you may be suicidal. The investigators will not provide clinical care but you will be provided a list of resources.</p> <p>The treatment or procedure may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable.</p> <p>At the beginning of the survey, the application will remind you to go to a quiet, distraction-free location where you will be able to speak out loud. It is best to complete the surveys in a room without any other people.

My most MEMORABLE moment was riding on the Caterpillar, which is a gigantic rollercoaster high above the ground. When I saw how high the Caterpillar rose into the bright blue sky I knew it was for me. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, \u201cThere's no turning back now.\u201d People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar. Taking a trip to the amusement park and riding on the Caterpillar was my MOST memorable moment ever!",
